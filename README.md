# Hi there, I'm Vinicius! üëã

I've been working with TypeScript, Node, and React for a year and a half, during which I've started and completed 4 projects and participated in over 15 projects.

### Highlighted Project: ncxopenbanking
In this project, I utilized Node with Domain-Driven Design (DDD), Nest js, React, and PostgreSQL. The platform has an average of 300 daily logins and 600 customer accesses. Key features I implemented include:
- Real-time chat using WebSocket
- Order tracking system with email notifications for administrators
- Automatic commission registration system post-sales
- Deploy backend, frontend and database at Digital Ocean
- Biggest difficults in this project: understand all business logic (flux of selling products, flux of comission according to different type of users and percentage of comission)
 

Additionally, I've integrated various APIs such as Stripe, Efi Pix, ChatGPT, League of Legends, and more.
