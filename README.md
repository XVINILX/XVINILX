# Hi there, I'm Vinicius! ðŸ‘‹

I've been working with TypeScript, Node, and React for a year and a half, during which I've started and completed 4 projects and participated in over 15 projects.

### Highlighted Project: [ncxopenbanking.com.br](https://ncxopenbanking.com.br)
In this project, I utilized Node with Domain-Driven Design (DDD), React, and PostgreSQL. The platform has an average of 300 daily logins and 600 customer accesses. Key features I implemented include:
- Real-time chat using WebSocket
- Order tracking system with email notifications for administrators
- Automatic commission registration system post-sales

Additionally, I've integrated various APIs such as Stripe, Efi Pix, ChatGPT, League of Legends, and more.
